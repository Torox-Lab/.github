# Torox Lab

Building the Future of Decentralized Gaming

Welcome to Torox Lab, where we empower developers to create fully decentralized, Web3-native games. Our mission is to advance the gaming industry by providing tools and frameworks that enable peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, anonymity, and blockchain integration, eliminating the need for centralized servers.

## Vision

Torox Lab envisions a future where games are built by developers, run by players, and owned by communities. We believe in the power of decentralization to make gaming fairer, more secure, and more private for everyone.

## Key Features

P2P Networking: Tools for creating games where clients act as nodes in a decentralized network, reducing reliance on centralized servers.

Anonymity Networks: Integration with networks like Tor or I2P to protect player privacy and anonymity.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Secure verification for in-game assets, allowing players to prove ownership without revealing private data.

Blockchain Integration: Built-in tools to easily connect games to various blockchains, enabling NFT creation, wallet connectivity, and seamless transactions.

Developer SDKs: Comprehensive SDKs to reduce development time and complexity for blockchain-integrated games.
